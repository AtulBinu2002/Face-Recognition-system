# Face-Recognition-system
To design a system that identifies and recongises face
Steps
1. Creating the datasets(Taking 100 Images)
2. Cropping only the face
3. Spliting file into training,valadation and testing
4. Data Augmentation and Preprocressing
5. Designing a model using pretrained model
6. Appropriate Hyperparameters
7. Fine-Tunning
8. Evaluate the model
9. Repeat the previous 3 steps until the valadation accuracy about 90%
10. Test the model real-time.
